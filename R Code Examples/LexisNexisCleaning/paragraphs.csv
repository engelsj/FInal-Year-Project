1,1,"Campbell River RCMP are investigating after Thursday night's fire at the local Walmart."
1,2,"Fire Investigators, Forensic Identification Units and the Major Crimes Unit have determined that the fire was intentionally set as a distraction for a significant theft from the store. Investigators have not released a description of what was taken or its value."
1,3,"This crime was extremely serious and costly in nature, said Const. Maury Tyre. The damage to the building and it's goods is yet to be fully assessed, but it's safe to say that there are extensive monetary damages."
1,4,"RCMP have also released a description of their suspect. According to a press release, RCMP are looking for a male who was wearing a grey jacket, black pants which could be cargo pants, a two tone possibly grey and black ball cap and black sneakers with white soles."
1,5,"Investigators are processing video and forensic evidence. RCMP hope to have further information to release to the public in the next few days, including photos of the suspect."
1,6,"Crimes like these have far reaching effects that most criminals don't even think of,"" Tyre said. ""The financial damage it can do to employees while a location is closed isn't a trivial matter and the sheer costs of cleanup and replacement of goods drive insurance costs higher which drive costs to consumers higher in the long run. Fortunately nobody was injured as a result of the fire, but this suspect put lives of customer's, staff, and fire crews at risk. Really the entire community should wish to see this person brought to justice."
1,7,"Though the store is closed for the foreseeable future, pharmacy patients can have orders processed at the nearest Walmart location in Courtenay, the RCMP said."
1,8,"Anyone with information on the crime are asked to contact the Campbell River RCMP at 250-286-6221. The public is reminded that the RCMP's Facebook page is not a platform for reports or tips, and that information shared with police should not be shared over social media."

3,21,"THE billionaire brothers behind petrol forecourt firm EG Group and private equity firm TDR Capital have won the Â£6.8 billion takeover battle for supermarket giant Asda."
3,22,"Walmart, the supermarket chain's US owner, has accepted a bid led by Lancashire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa following a lengthy auction process."
3,23,"Walmart will retain a minority stake in Asda as part of the agreement. The new owners have committed to keeping the retailer's headquarters in Leeds and has said it will invest to grow its convenience and online operations."
3,24,"It comes more than a year after a proposed merger between Asda and UK supermarket rival Sainsbury's was torpedoed by regulators. Asda has seen its fortunes improve recently with trading strengthening through 2020, as shoppers have spent more money on groceries during the pandemic. In the quarter to June, Asda saw online sales double but the new owners will be tasked with expanding its digital business further to take advantage of soaring demand and make ground on rivals, such as Tesco, who have a larger slice of the market."
3,25,"The new owners will also face the challenge of keeping prices low amid tough economic conditions for shoppers and potential new tariffs on EU-imported foods, with the other big four supermarkets all announcing a raft of price cuts in recent months."
3,26,"EG Group has sealed the deal after its offer was favoured by Walmart ahead of a move by US private equity firm Apollo."
3,27,"Last week, a third bid from Lone Star Funds, fronted by former Asda executive Paul Mason, was dropped after failing to meet the price of its rivals during the latter stage of bidding."
3,28,"Walmart sought a sale after the UK's competition regulator blocked its merger with Sainsbury's amid fears the move would push up prices and reduce product quality. The US grocery started new discussions over a sale of Asda in February, but saw these halted due to disruption as a result of the pandemic."
3,29,"However, the auction process restarted in July as Walmart sought to exit the UK, 21 years after first purchasing the Leedsbased retailer."
3,30,"Blackburn-based EG Group, formerly known as Euro Garages, already runs forecourt convenience stores for Spar and French hypermarket chain Carrefour. The deal will have to pass through regulators, although it is expected to be given the green light."
3,31,"Last week, EG Group announced a trial involving three ""Asda on the Move"" convenience stores at its petrol forecourts."
3,32,"TDR Capital, which also owns the UK's largest pub group Stonegate, owns a 50 per cent stake in EG Group, sharing ownership with the Issa brothers."
4,33,"Asda Q3 results for the UK supermarket chain. U.S. parent company Walmart, the world's biggest retailer by revenue, also announces its Q3 results."
4,34," It was announced in October that the Issa brothers and TDR Capital are acquiring a majority ownership stake in Asda, with Walmart retaining an equity investment in the business. The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2021"

5,38,"Walmart and IBM conducted a pilot test on Walmart's mango and pork value chains to verify the potential of blockchain technology to facilitate food traceability, support food safety controls, and ensure food authenticity, according to an FAO report."
5,39,"From the beginning, Walmart decided to test the project with fresh mangoes from Mexico due to the complexity of the value chain."
5,40,"Using blockchain technology reduced the time it takes to trace the origin of a prepackaged slice of handles from nearly seven days to 2.2 seconds."
5,41,"According to FAO, technology allowed actors in the value chain to identify the exact path the product took from the farm to the store."
5,42,"The blockchain solution also allowed Walmart to track the speed at which handles moved through the supply chain and identify where the delays occurred."
5,43,"Walmart and logistics"
5,44,"In the People's Republic of China, Walmart used blockchain technology to ensure the origin and authenticity of pork."
5,45,"The country has experienced strong and sustained demand for pork over the years, and blockchain pilot technology successfully increased transparency and addressed consumer confidence issues."
5,46,"The pilot resulted in additional benefits, such as a reduction in the time required to access veterinary certificates, as well as greater confidence in veterinary control."
5,47,"There are many more initiatives underway in agri-food value chains to test blockchain usage to solve traceability challenges."
5,48,"For example, Carrefour developed a blockchain for its branded chicken, providing consumers with more information on poultry farming and supply chain."

6,53,"RCMP said they were told the duo piled up the groceries in a cart and also grabbed some camera supplies and then left the store without paying."
6,54,"The suspects were both males but no names or ages are known at this point."
6,55,"RCMP said one suspect had short black hair, had a pierced left ear and was wearing dark pants, a red/black/blue jacket and had a grey string backpack."
6,56,"The other suspect was a white male who had a neck/chest tattoo. He was wearing a black or grey hat, a dark button-up shirt, a belt with a large belt buckle and dark pants."
6,57,"Details are scarce in the case but RCMP are hoping someone knows the suspects or has any tips in the case."
6,58,"RCMP are appealing for anyone with information to come forward or report it to them."

9,72,"A trip to Walmart might soon remind you of shopping on the retailer's app."
9,73,"Walmart unveiled a reimagined store design Wednesday rolling out to 200 locations this fiscal year, which ends in early 2021, and 1,000 by next fiscal year that officials said will create a ""seamless"" omni shopping experience with more self-checkout kiosks and contactless payment options."
9,74,"Janey Whiteside, the retailer's chief customer officer, said the design was planned before the coronavirus pandemic and one of the goals is to save shoppers time."
9,75,"""We're working hard to make it easy for customers to be able to toggle between their physical experiences that are in the store and their digital journeys,"" Whiteside told USA TODAY. ""We think customers are going to really enjoy and find this a much easier shopping experience."""
9,76,"Whiteside said Walmart tested the redesign in select stores in Arkansas and it evolved based on shopper and employee feedback. She said the design will come to more stores this fall and will continue to evolve based on feedback."
9,77,"""By the end of this fiscal year, the experience will be in nearly 200 Supercenters as well as in select Health Centers and Neighborhood Markets, reaching close to 1,000 stores by next fiscal year,"" Whiteside said in a blog post."
9,78,"Walmart's reimagined store design"
9,79,"Whiteside said the design was inspired by ""airport wayfinding systems as best-in-class examples of how to navigate large groups of people."""
9,80,"Signs inside and outside stores will be updated to reflect the Walmart app icon, and visual reminders will encourage shoppers to download the app and use its item finder and map to navigate around the store."
9,81,"The design focuses ""on getting what you want as quickly as possible, so you're not endlessly walking up and down aisles looking for items,"" Whiteside said. The layout will bring greater visibility to sections dedicated to electronics, toys, baby products and more."
9,82,"Self-checkout kiosks will use contactless payment, including Walmart Pay, ""to limit contact between associates and customers,"" Whiteside said."
9,83,"Select locations will have Scan & Go, part of the new Walmart+ membership program, she said in the blog post. The in-store feature will allow shoppers to scan items as they shop, then pay using Walmart Pay."
9,84,"Contactless payment, item finder"
9,85,"Regardless of whether your Walmart is one of the first to get redesigned, there are some features available to all shoppers using the app, including the item finder with the maps and Walmart Pay options."
9,86,"A few months ago, Walmart combined its Walmart Grocery app with its main app to allow consumers to shop for items in multiple departments, much like a trip to one of the company's Supercenter stores."
9,87,"Until the upgrade, shoppers could pick up groceries only at curbside but were able to order items from other departments for pickup in the store. The pandemic sped up Walmart's plans to integrate the apps because of a surge in online and mobile shopping, Whiteside said."
9,88,"Whiteside said COVID-19 advanced plans for the store design rollout and contactless efforts. Customer interest and ease using contactless options has increased, she said."
9,89,"""Whether you get the redesign now, next year or moving forward, you'll still have access to Walmart+, Scan & Go, the delivery options,"" Whiteside said. ""This will just be another supporting aspect of that."" "
10,90,"Labor Law"
10,91,"Walmart has agreed to pay $20 million to settle a companywide hiring lawsuit filed against the retail giant by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging sex discrimination."
10,92," At issue was Walmart requiring applicants to successfully complete a physical agility test when applying to be an ""order filler"" at its grocery distribution centers nationwide. The test disproportionately excluded female applicants, resulting in disparate impact on women."
10,93," When a pre-employment test results in a disparate impact, the employer must show that the test is necessary for the safe and efficient performance of the specific job, and that there are not alternative practices that can achieve the employer's objectives but have a less discriminatory effect."
10,94," In announcing the settlement earlier this month, the EEOC said: ""One of the EEOC's six national priorities is eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring. Employers need to ensure their testing and screening practices do not discriminate against any group."""
10,95," In addition to the financial settlement, Walmart agreed to cease all physical agility testing for the position."
10,96," This case is a reminder that even where a business has not engaged in intentional discrimination, its policies and practices may inadvertently cause individuals to be denied opportunities in violation of discrimination laws."
10,97," Most companies appropriately set forth policies and procedures to prevent explicit discrimination and bias. As the nation continues dialogue on implicit bias, employers should do more to uncover the implicit bias preventing individuals from advancement."
10,98," Employers should be testing every aspect of their employment practices to determine if and where people of color, women, those with disabilities and others fall out of the system. Employers should be examining hiring practices, promotions, compensation, and other benefits."
10,99," In doing so, businesses should carefully examine criteria currently being required, but which might not be necessary for the successful performance of the position, such as degrees or certifications."
10,100," In addition, employers should carefully examine any pre-employment testing (be it physical or otherwise) to make sure that the test is validated for that specific position, and that the criteria is properly administered."
10,101," Sometimes, for example, a test is validated for one position if the person scores above 70 and then the employer may arbitrarily increase the criteria to a passing score of 80, thus resulting in a disparate impact without a legitimate criterion being applied."
10,102," The process to uncovering these types of potential biases begins with intentional planning and assessment. Employers should review each job description, hiring practice, promotional opportunity, compensation practices and similar employment benefits to determine whether the established criteria are necessary for the successful performance of the role. Then, remove unnecessary and non-essential criterion that create barriers, thus promoting and creating equal opportunities."
10,103," Removing unnecessary barriers and stereotypes in the hiring and promotions process will bring employers closer to achieving the necessary equity within organizations."

12,134,"Walmart, America's largest retailer, is changing the shopping experience at its stores in preparation for the coming holiday season by redesigning its locations in the mold of an airport terminal that would be navigated by using its app."
12,135,"The company announced last week that it was revamping the layout and signage of its locations to speed up shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic and better cater to smartphone-armed customers."
12,136,"The Bentonville, Arkansas-based giant said that the look, which includes signs with bold dimensional typeface spotlighting sections, is currently in one store. "
12,137,"Walmart Supercenter in Springdale, Arkansas, is the only store that has implemented the new layout. "
12,138,"It will be rolled out to 200 stores by early next year with plans to add another 800 stores by early 2022. "
12,139,"Walmart says it was working on a new store layout a year ago. "
12,140,"But the pandemic accelerated those efforts as customers are increasingly focused on contactless shopping amid safety concerns."
12,141,"'We were inspired by airport wayfinding systems as best-in-class examples of how to navigate large groups of people,' says Janey Whiteside, executive vice president and chief customer officer at Walmart's US division, in a corporate blog."
12,142," HOW CUSTOMERS WILL SHOP AT WALMART'S REDESIGNED STORES "
12,143,"Walmart's reconfigured stores are designed in a way to encourage customers to download its smartphone app before setting foot inside."
12,144,"Shoppers could then use the app to browse the items they are looking for in the various departments."
12,145,"After picking an item, customers would then be guided by a map to the specific aisle where the product they chose is located."
12,146,"Shoppers will be able to pay for the item via the contactless checkout or through the app."
12,147,"For those who come to Walmart locations without using the app, the new, larger signage around the store is designed to make it easier to navigate the aisles and speed up the shopping experience. "
12,148,"Walmart customers will also have the option of ordering their items at home and then driving to a specially marked pickup lot near the store where an associate would load the purchased products into the trunk of the vehicle. "
12,149,"For those who prefer to stay home and have their groceries and other items delivered, Walmart offers customers the option of paying a $98-a-year annual membership."
12,150,"That entitles the customer to free, unlimited delivery - though only for purchases that are a minimum of $35. "
12,151,"The membership with Walmart + is part of the retailer's strategy of competing head-to-head with its main rival, Amazon, and its subscription service Amazon Prime."
12,152,"Amazon is worth $1.58trillion - or more than four times Walmart's market capitalization. A major reason is Amazon Prime. "
12,153,"For $119 annually, Amazon Prime members who number some 150 million people worldwide get free, unlimited express delivery of groceries and other items as well as other perks, including digital media content and discounts at Amazon-owned Whole Foods. "
12,154,"Walmart + intends to introduce more perks to its members, including discounts at gas stations as well as online, family-friendly entertainment video content."
12,155,"As part of the overall signage, the exterior and interior of the stores will reflect the Walmart app icon. "
12,156,"As customers enter the store, they will see colorful iconography and a store directory that encourages them to download and use the Walmart app while they shop. "
12,157,"It says its aisles will feature letter and number combinations to guide customers from phone to products."
12,158,"It's also featuring dedicated sections within the store for toys, baby products and other areas. "
12,159,"Shoppers who don't use their smartphones for shopping will still benefit with the bigger signs, which will help them find items, Whiteside noted."
12,160,"Walmart redesign was done in concert with FITCH, one of the world's leading retail consultancy firms."
12,161,"'We worked side-by-side with Walmart to create a dynamic store design that will inspire customers and offer them a more seamless end-to-end shopping experience,' said Brandon Boston, FITCH's design director."
12,162,"'This store represents what it means to ""Live Better""- its mobile-first, it makes shopping much easier, and it can be scaled to support communities throughout the US.' "
12,163,"Alvis Washington, Walmart's vice president of marketing, told DailyMail.com that the changes are part of a plan to 'embrace a truly digitally enabled omni shopping experience.'"
12,164,"'We set out to create a more engaging experience that would allow both our associates and customers to better navigate their shopping needs in a highly customized and convenient way,' Washington said."

13,166,"Sept. 30-- Sep. 30--Bree Jones had everyone fooled. A friend, neighbors, even the police thought he was a federal agent."
13,167,"Charging documents authored by police show he duped a man into loaning him a handgun, befriended cops and walked around his apartment complex in Glen Burnie dressed in law enforcement apparel."
13,168,"Of course his name wasn't Bree Jones, it's Renul Barnet Forbes, according to court documents. And he wasn't a U.S. Marshal, but a convincing impostor."
13,169,"It appears Forbes' deceitful streak came to a conclusion Saturday at a Walmart in Glen Burnie, when an Anne Arundel officer moonlighting at the retail giant noticed a man carrying a handgun on his hip, who, when confronted, claimed to be a U.S. Marshal. The off-duty cop detained him and awaited for backup to arrive and uncover the truth."
13,170,"Forbes, of Americana Circle, has been charged with dozens of offenses related to impersonating a law enforcement officer and illegally possessing a handgun, court records show. More charges may be pending."
13,171,"A $5,000 unsecured personal bond was posted for Forbes Saturday. The 31-year-old does not have an attorney listed in court records."
13,172,"County police officers arrived at the Walmart at 6721 Chesapeake Center Drive around 12:30 p.m. after being called out to do a ""check subject."""
13,173,"In the parking lot, officers met with their off-duty colleague and a man who was openly carrying what appeared to be a Glock handgun. Approached by the off-duty cop, police wrote in charging documents for Forbes that he refused to show the officer his badge."
13,174,"When backup arrived, police wrote Forbes ""lifted up his sweatshirt and said 'oh this badge?'"""
13,175,"Forbes exposed a firearm, handcuffs and additional magazines on his belt when he pulled up his sweatshirt. Police said the badge was pinned to the same belt, but it took a while for officers to determine it was a fraud. Forbes repeated that he was a U.S. Marshal, saying that people around Glen Burnie had seen him out and about in his uniform."
13,176,"Before officers responding to the Walmart arrived, Forbes had called another county police officer to tell him about the encounter, charging documents show. Forbes allegedly claimed to know a host of officers who work out of the Northern District Station in Brooklyn Park. Police said the officer Forbes called had text messages to prove Forbes identified himself as a federal agent."
13,177,"But it wasn't adding up. After all, the 31-year-old had a suspended license and was cagey about showing his credentials."
13,178,"Charging documents show the county police officers contacted their own supervisors. Two sergeants and lieutenant descended on the scene. They asked Forbes to put them in contact with his supervisor."
13,179,"Forbes gave them a number; police called it. But the person that picked up the phone admitted they were no federal agent, the court record shows."
13,180,"A county police sergeant called a supervisor with the U.S. Marshal Service, a federal agency responsible for security at federal courthouses and fugitive apprehension. The agent wasn't ambiguous: arrest Forbes, they said, according to charging documents."
13,181,"Federal authorities told county police they would pursue additional charges."
13,182,"From his waist, they confiscated an air-soft pistol resembling a Glock handgun and a real magazine loaded with hollow-tip rounds, court records show."
13,183,"Police wrote that Walmart management wanted Forbes' vehicle towed, court records show. Inside, officers found evidence of what made his disguise so convincing -- and concerning."
13,184,"The black Ford Taurus was equipped with police lights and sirens rigged through USB ports that plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. Police wrote Forbes could control the lights from a panel on the driver's side visor. The panel could make the lights flash blue and red at different speeds and directions."
13,185,"Officers also found a brown backpack, the court records show. Inside, they located a loose hollow-tip round and Springfield handgun. The Maryland State Police Gun Center told officers Forbes was prohibited from possessing a gun or ammo; the silver and black pistol was registered to another man. Police called the unsuspecting man."
13,186,"He allegedly told them he felt comfortable loaning it to a U.S. Marshal."

17,223,"On a Friday morning in June 2009, Walmart's then-chief executive officer Mike Duke stood in front of thousands of employees and shareholders at a star-studded corporate gala and announced that the world's largest retailer needed more female leaders."
17,224,"His pledge to make changes would have a major unintended consequence: a setback for Black representation."
17,225,"Duke that day unveiled a global women's council designed to help boost the share of women in senior leadership roles, then at 27 per cent - a glaring disparity, when women made up more than half of Walmart's U.S. workforce. Jump forward 11 years, and Walmart has boosted that share to nearly one-third. Meantime, the share of Black leadership roles has declined recently."
17,226,"Walmart's focus on women - spurred by a classaction gender discrimination lawsuit - left Black men and women on the outside looking in, according to a half-dozen African-American former associates who worked at Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. These people, who requested anonymity as some still live there and all fear retribution for criticizing the nation's largest employer, depicted an environment where promising Black staffers repeatedly failed to break into the company's officer ranks, while white women gained, buttressed by a strong career-development network."
17,227,"What happened inside Walmart offers a lesson for other companies trying to diversify their management ranks. As the nation's biggest private employer, Walmart sets a standard with its workforce policies that other big employers typically follow. The retailer also has held itself up as a leader this year by making one of the largest corporate commitments to battling racial inequality, with a US$100-million pledge."
17,228,"Walmart Inc. isn't the only retailer with a poor track record on race: At Target Corp., its cheap-chic rival, only three of the top 54 executives are Black. Costco had no Black senior executives as of 2018, according to the most recent data available, and the leadership team at electronics retailer Best Buy Co. is also dominated by white faces. Elevating women while neglecting Black employees'career advancement is also endemic across much of U.S. industry, including on corporate boards, where white women have made gains in recent years while racial minorities have lagged behind."
17,229,"Black workers say they recall being aggressively recruited to join Walmart, then quickly realizing once they arrived that they weren't part of the predominantly white informal networks - based on local university and church affiliations - that supply a disproportionate share of Walmart's top leaders."
17,230,"Over the years, Walmart has often sought advice from noted Black leaders such as the Reverend Al Sharpton, but failed to listen closely enough to those in its own ranks."
17,231,"For those reasons and others, from 2015 until the middle of this year, the share of Black people in officer roles declined from 8.7 per cent to 6.9 per cent, in a 1.5 million-strong Walmart U.S. workforce that now is 21 per cent Black. Their share of middle-management jobs hasn't budged in five years, according to Walmart."
17,232,"(A Bloomberg request for data going back to 2005, when Walmart first began disclosing diversity figures to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, was denied due to a lack of ""bandwidth."") Walmart's chief people officer Donna Morris denies that the gains made by women came at the expense of Black staffers, but acknowledged that the company's efforts to identify and promote talented minorities needs to improve. A few have risen recently, such as Dacona Smith, now COO of the U.S. business."
17,233,"But many of Walmart's promising Black leaders have left to lead other organizations: Roz Brewer, who once ran the company's Sam's Club warehouse division, is now the chief operating officer of Starbucks Corp. and sits on the board of Walmart archrival Amazon.com Inc. Don Frieson, a logistics expert and onetime COO of Sam's Club, now oversees the supply chain for home-improvement retailer Lowe's Cos. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, a former executive vice-president and treasurer, now leads the nation's biggest food bank. Jeffrey Davis, once the chief financial officer of the U.S. business, left to be the finance chief of Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. before returning to the retail sector. Phyllis Harris, Walmart's former head of legal operations, is now the top lawyer for the American Red Cross."
17,234,"Walmart's shortchanging of Black managers, however unintentional, is jarring in light of its recent US$100-million plan in the wake of George Floyd's killing to create a centre on racial equity that promises to ""use the power of Walmart"" to find ways to address systemic racism. CEO Doug Mc-Millon, in announcing the pledge, said the company also needed to ""actively shape our culture to be more inclusive"" and warned that managers who didn't promote diversity would need to find work elsewhere."
17,235,"""Words and feelings matter but they are not enough,"" said McMillon, who also is chairman of Business Roundtable, giving him one of the loudest bullhorns in corporate America. Walmart has taken some action already. It has promised to post all job openings at the vice-president level and below internally first, to encourage in-house candidates."
17,236,"It will also release its diversity and inclusion statistics twice a year rather than annually."
17,237,"""I want Walmart to be known for its people practices,"" said Morris, who joined the company in February from Adobe Inc. ""I'm not sure if we are now."""
17,238,"Walmart, in its campaign to elevate women, isn't the first big company to experience unintended fallout from a well-intentioned diversity initiative. Research on why these efforts fail has become a cottage industry in academia."
17,239,"For starters, such initiatives often are reactive - a response to high-profile litigation, as in Walmart's case, or fear of embarrassing revelations. Second, the programs themselves force-feed diversity to reluctant managers, according to a 2016 Harvard Business Review article, which can ""activate bias rather than stamp it out."" The authors, Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev, analyzed 816 U.S. companies and found that popular interventions such as mandatory diversity training and grievance systems actually made those businesses less diverse over five years."
17,240,"""You won't get managers on board by blaming and shaming them with rules and re-education,"" Dobbin and Kalev wrote. ""People often respond to compulsory courses with anger and resistance - and many participants actually report more animosity toward other groups afterward."""
17,241,"Walmart's error was channelling its firepower to fix one glaring problem in response to the gender discrimination suit, then failing to do the same for its 340,000 Black U.S. employees, a population nearly the size of Cleveland. Such tunnel vision is common, according to experts in the field."
17,242,"""They go all in on some aspect of diversity,"" says Steve Bucherati, the former chief diversity officer at Coca-Cola Co., ""and take their eye off the ball when it comes to the broader aspects of the work."""
17,243,"While organizations spend billions of dollars every year on diversity programs, consultants and conferences, the problem persists, especially for Black managers."
17,244,"Meanwhile, women have enjoyed gains over that same period, as they have at Walmart. Women now hold almost a third of executive roles, up from 27 per cent when Duke made his commitment in 2009."
17,245,"But most of the women are white, including the four who report directly to the CEO. There are no Black women or men in those high-profile roles, which lead to the top slot. Walmart has just one Black director, down from two a decade ago."
17,246,"Walmart's focus on women is apparent from the infrastructure it has to support them. Along with the global council that Duke launched 11 years ago - which has morphed into a broader ""inclusion"" council - there's the Women's Resource Community, a Women's Officer Caucus, and a Women in Retail Field Development Program for those outside the U.S."
17,247,"Much of this was an outgrowth of some advice Walmart got from another big company, Coke. In 2000, the beverage giant settled a lawsuit claiming widespread racial discrimination in pay and promotions, and thereafter became a model for diversity."
17,248,"Leaders in Walmart's human-resources department contacted Bucherati, who designed Coke's diversity initiatives in the wake of the settlement. He had created a global women's council at Coke, and Walmart asked for his assistance as it developed one of its own."
17,249,"In contrast, there are fewer groups inside Walmart that specifically focus on the development of Black employees."
17,250,"That's not to say Walmart doesn't want to hear from them: In 2018 McMillon led a two-day ""immersive listening tour"" of Montgomery, Ala., where he and other leaders visited sites made famous by the civil-rights movement."
17,251,"Last year he screened The Hate U Give multiple times for Walmart employees, and invited the movie's director George Tillman Jr. for a town hall conversation."
17,252,"And in the wake of George Floyd's death, Walmart said it would hold ""associate listening sessions"" where rankand-file employees can tell senior leaders ""how you're feeling,"" according to an internal memo from Morris."
17,253,"That's not enough, says Pamela Newkirk, author of Diversity, Inc.: The Failed Promise of a Billion-Dollar Business, which explains why corporate diversity efforts haven't really accomplished much. ""OK, you are listening now,"" she says. ""But what are you hearing and what will you do with the information?"" Some parts of Walmart have done well by Black employees, at least for a while."
17,254,"Its legal department during the 2000s recruited Black and Latino lawyers under the guidance of then-general counsel Tom Mars."
17,255,"But the progress fizzled when a new general counsel took over in 2009, the same year Duke began his women's initiative, according to people who worked there at the time."
17,256,"Two years later, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for Walmart in the gender-bias suit that was originally filed a decade earlier by lead plaintiff Betty Dukes, a Black female store greeter. In Walmart's diversity report that same year, CEO Duke cited the progress made in hiring more female store managers, saying they make ""our business stronger."""
17,257,"Walmart's uneven progress on diversity didn't get much attention before. Now, though, the stakes are higher, as the Black Lives Matter movement gains a foothold in the corporate mainstream."
17,258,"Walmart says it will accelerate its outreach toward all minorities. But Duke said the same thing in 2009, as did McMillon when he became CEO in 2014. CEOs often talk about moving faster on diversity, but where to? How do you convince those employees who are unwilling to act? And how do you create an environment where minorities can speak up without fear of retribution? These are the questions Walmart now has to ask itself."

18,263,"TWO billionaire brothers from Blackburn are poised to take control of Asda, returning the supermarket chain to British ownership for the first time in two decades after a surprise decision by US seller Walmart."
18,264,"Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the low-profile founders of petrol forecourt operator EG Group, have been selected as preferred bidders to take a controlling stake in the UK's third-biggest supermarket. The pair are working with British private equity firm TDR Capital. The decision is expected to be confirmed by Asda's current owner Walmart in the coming days."
18,265,"It follows weeks of frenzied negotiations in which Wall Street titan Apollo Global Management was the presumed favourite."
18,266,"Competition chiefs are expected to closely scrutinise the deal given that both sides have a major chunk of the petrol market."
18,267,"The Issas, whose interest was first reported by The Sunday Telegraph in March, had been widely discounted as Apollo duked it out with US rival Lone Star. Lone Star dropped out of the running last week."
18,268,"After initially exploring an approach bid through EG Group, the Blackburn brothers opted to back a bid by TDR using their personal fortune. EG already has debts of Â£7.3bn, according to analysis by Bloomberg earlier this year."
18,269,"A victory over $400bn (Â£315bn) fund Apollo will mark a major coup."
18,270,"SUPER TDR is considerably smaller than Apollo. Its investments include Stonegate, the UK's largest pub group, and We Buy Any Car owner BCA Market -JON place, as well as EG Group, which it owns jointly with the Issas."
18,271,"Apollo is understood to have worked hard to soothe concerns that it would launch a major cost-cutting exercise if it took charge of Asda."
18,272,"Concerns remain that under TDR stewardship, a programme of redun dancies and closures could be on the horizon. But deal insiders insist that the preferred bidders have given Walmart an assurance this is not on the cards."
18,273,"The sale of a majority stake follows Asda's aborted Â£10bn merger with Sainsbury's. Competition regulators blocked that deal last year, embarrassing the likes of Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who had been caught on camera singing ""we're in the money"" when the deal was first announced."
18,274,"It is understood that Walmart executives are desperate not to fall foul of regulators for a second time."
18,275,"Andrew Taylor, who offers advice on competition investigations and cofounded Aldwych Partners, said the deal is likely to pique the interest of the watchdog."
18,276,"Asda's ownership of petrol stations could lead to sell-offs if its sites are too close to EG's in some areas."
18,277,"Mr Taylor said: ""While a deal might not result in Asda and EG merging their networks, they would still be con nected. The Competition and Markets Authority could require them to sell those petrol stations."""
18,278,"The overlap, however, is not likely to be that great other than in the North of England where both businesses have more sites."
18,279,"Clive Black, a retail analyst at broker Shore Capital, said that should the brothers emerge victorious, ""then this is a remarkable case of immense ambition, courage and entrepreneurship on behalf of the siblings""."
18,280,"Asda's market share was 14.3pc in August, well behind Tesco's 26.6pc, while Sainsbury's had 14.9pc."

20,304," The 'super app' aims to create a digital services behemoth offering a wide range of products in the retail space. The super app, scheduled to be launched in India in December or January, is estimated to be valued at around $50 billion to $60 billion. "
20,305," As per the talks between Tata and Walmart, the super app could be launched as a joint venture between both companies. It may combine Flipkart's offerings from Walmart and the entire retail product franchise housed by the Tata group on one platform for retail customers."

21,309,"Or, at this point, at least slowing down."
21,310,"Ward 3 Coun. Matthew Shoemaker asked city council to defer a motion Monday to give Walmart, the city, Superior Bakery and other businesses time to come to the table to negotiate how the laneway that runs east from Great Northern Road to the Walmart parking lot can be accessed by neighbouring businesses."
21,311,"Last week Shoemaker had called Walmart ""a difficult neighbour"" because repeated requests to the retail giant to give neighbouring businesses access to the laneway went unanswered by corporate headquarters."
21,312,"""I believe we may have some progress,"" Shoemaker told city council, suggesting that he believed Walmart is now prepared to come to the table and discuss the issue with the other parties."
21,313,"A rezoning in February 2018 to approve the new Pino's grocery store on Great Northern Road also included the approval of a traffic light to be installed at a to-be constructed entrance to Pino's adjacent to the Walmart laneway, just north of Superior Bakery."
21,314,"That created concern for Superior Bakery and other nearby businesses who feared it would make access in and out of their parking lot an issue."
21,315,"The problem can be solved if Walmart allows Superior Bakery access to its laneway, simply by cutting the curb and allowing its customers to access the future traffic light."
21,316,"The busy north-south traffic on Great Northern Road makes it difficult to turn onto the street from businesses like Superior Home Bakery, Shoemaker said."
21,317,"Shoemaker said that given that Walmart has now responded to the stakeholders and ""seemed very open"" to finding a resolution on the issue, his motion should be deferred to at least the next meeting. That will give the parties time to talk, he said."

23,341,"A more comprehensive ban remains scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. The judge, Carl Nichols of the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia, did not agree to postpone the later ban."
23,342,"The ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration's app-store ban would infringe on U.S. First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business."
23,343,"This year, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that TikTok, owned by Chinese company Bytedance, was a threat to national security and that it must either sell its U.S. operations to American companies or be barred from the country."
23,344,"TikTok is still scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with Oracle, a huge database-software company, and Walmart in an effort to win the blessing of both the Chinese and U.S. governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the United States."
23,345,"TikTok said in a statement that it was pleased with the court ruling and continues to work to turn its deal proposal into an actual agreement."
23,346,"The U.S. Commerce Department, which is responsible for the specific orders banning TikTok, said it will comply with the judge's order but intends to vigorously defend the administration's efforts against the app."
23,347,"Judge Nichols did not explain his reasoning publicly, and instead filed his judicial opinion under seal. Initially both the U.S. government's brief in the case and the entire Sunday morning hearing were also due to be sealed from the public, although the court later relented."
23,348,"In arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app, since it functions as a ""modern-day version of a town square."""
23,349,"""If that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,'"" Hall said. ""It would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square"" at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election."
23,350,"TikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would affect the ability of tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators to express themselves every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent."
23,351,"In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security."
23,352,"U.S. Justice Department lawyer Daniel Schwei said Chinese companies are not purely private and are subject to intrusive laws compelling their co-operation with intelligence agencies."

23,354,"""This is the most immediate national security threat,"" argued Schwei. ""It is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out."""
23,355,"Schwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove the company would suffer irreparable business harm."
23,356,"The Justice Department laid out its objections to TikTok's motion for a temporary injunction in a brief under seal, but it was unsealed in redacted form to protect confidential business information."
23,357,"Trump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities."
23,358,"Trump has given tentative approval to a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20 per cent of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global."
23,359,"But Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn't have ""total control"" of the company; the president did not explain what he meant by that."
23,360,"The deal remains unfinalized, and the two sides have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. Bytedance said last week that it will still own 80 per cent of the U.S. entity after a financing round."
23,361,"Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans ""will be the majority and Bytedance will have no ownership in TikTok Global."""

23,366,"The Chinese firm said the president doesn't have the authority to take these actions under the national-security law he cited; that the ban violates TikTok's First Amendment speech rights and Fifth Amendment due-process rights; and that there's no authority for the restrictions because they are not based on a national emergency."
25,394,"Fortified by an initial public offering, Oak Street Health is moving into new markets and testing a less familiar business model as it navigates the COVID-19 pandemic."
25,395,"The Chicago-based network of primary care clinics for people 65 and older, many of whom have complex medical and social needs, raised $352 millionwhen it went public last month."
25,396,"The initial public offering gives Oak Street the capital to execute its aggressive growth plan, which includes building new senior-focused centers across the country and piloting three Walmart-based clinics for patients of all ages. But the funds come with more intense, short-term scrutiny for the company, which has operated in the red since launching in 2012."
25,397,"Now Oak Street will have to manage such pressure on top of controlling rising medical costs and improving health outcomes for high-risk patients during a public health crisis."
25,398,"""At a time when primary care is struggling, our model is further needed,"" says CEO Mike Pykosz. ""We already felt that our model could provide much higher-quality care, but now COVID just really added another layer to that."""
25,399,"Many doctors who get paid for each medical service provided saw revenues tank as people avoided in-person care earlier in the pandemic. But primary care practices like Oak Street that collect a fixed amount to keep patients healthy fared better."
25,400,"Oak Street quickly shifted to telehealth earlier this year and repurposed its patient transport vans to deliver meals from food pantries. Still, the pandemic stalled the company's rapid expansion."
25,401,"But in the last six weeks, Oak Street has opened 12 new centers-expanding its network to 66 locations in nine states-and announced a deal with Walmart to open clinics at three stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Oak Street expects to have 75 clinics in 11 states by year-end."
25,402,"""It's a risk anytime a company is growing as rapidly as they are,"" says William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels. ""They've proven through almost 70 centers now a very predictable and consistent patient ramp and profit ramp, so I think it can be replicated. But if you're going to go from 54 centers at the start of the year to 150 centers three or four years from now-and maybe it won't be that many-that's a lot of growth. They have to make sure they continue to keep the culture, keep the management talent."""
25,403,"In the longer term, the pandemic could make older adults less willing to visit health care facilities or lead insurers to favor home-based care, Piper Sandler analyst Sean Wieland warns in an Aug. 31 report. But with investments in primary care yielding savings down the road ($1 in primary care saves the health care system an average of $13, Oregon researchers found), it's likely that ""primary care will enjoy anointed status in the post-COVID healthcare delivery paradigm,"" Wieland writes."
25,404,"PAYMENT MODELS"
25,405,"The Walmart clinics for patients of all ages will take Oak Street outside its comfort zone and core Medicare business. While older patients will be treated under Oak Street's standard value-based model of care, in which Medicare and Medicare Advantage insurers pay a set amount per patient, those with other insurance plans will be treated under the more widespread fee-for-service, or volume-based, payment model."
25,406,"Pykosz says the goal of the partnership is to test whether clinics in Walmarts, which tend to be in more suburban and rural locations than Oak Street, attract more new patients. For Walmart, the deal is another step toward its vision of becoming ""America's neighborhood health destination."""
25,407,"Oak Street could face increased competition as more providers move into its core business. In addition to senior-focused rivals like Chicago-based VillageMD and Miami-based ChenMed, a number of independent doctors, hospitals and health systems will be looking to capture a piece of the growing Medicare-eligible population."
25,408,"Oak Street's patients have an average income of $20,700, and about half struggle with at least one social factor that affects health, such as food insecurity, while 40 percent have a behavioral health diagnosis, according to the company's prospectus."
25,409,"During the company's second-quarter earnings call, Pykosz said the estimated size of Oak Street's target market is 27 million moderate- to low-income Medicare-eligible patients living in suburban and urban areas, which translates to a $325 billion annual market opportunity."
25,410,"""At the end of the second quarter, we cared for up to 85,000 of these lives, which represents less than 5 percent of the addressable Medicare population in the markets we currently operate in, and an even tinier fraction of the overall market opportunity,"" Pykosz said on the call."
25,411,"Beyond the attractive market, Daniels says Oak Street's Medicare-focused model isn't in jeopardy despite the upcoming presidential election, which has serious implications for the way health care is delivered."
25,412,"""Regardless of who sits in the presidency, it's very favorable for Medicare Advantage,"" Daniels says. ""If it's Trump, it's status quo. If it's Biden, you may even see expansion of Medicare Advantage or taking down the age limit or buying into Medicare."""
25,413,"And Oak Street's planned participation in a new program from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that bypasses insurers could be a boon if it brings the company more patients and higher profit margins, as expected."
25,414,"But sooner or later, Wall Street is going to want to see a profit. Revenue increased 75 percent in 2019 to $556.6 million, while the company's net loss expanded 37 percent to $109.4 million. On Sept. 16, it reported second-quarter revenue of $214.4 million and a net loss of $26.8 million-in line with preliminary estimates. Since debuting at $21 apiece on Aug. 6, Oak Street shares surged as high as $53.58 on Sept. 2 before retreating to $45.12 on Sept. 24."
26,415,"WALMART China is shifting gears to rapidly embrace digital technologies by adopting tech-enabled applications in its brick-and-mortar stores, with its OCT store in Nanshan District of Shenzhen becoming the retailerâs first store that leverages state-of-the-art technologies to optimize store operations and improve customer experience."
26,416," Some of the applications that have been put into use in its OCT store includes smart shopping carts, intelligent self-service fresh produce scales, an AI-powered camera that assists with replenishment, and a wireless temperature logger, the retailer said Thursday."
26,417," In January 2019, Walmart China launched its Omega 8 innovation platform, which aims to help open cross-industry communication channels and extend cross-border innovation."
26,418," According to the retail giant, the platform serves as a bridge between technology companies and Walmart to jointly create technical solutions for the more difficult aspects of retail. After more than a year of development, the platform has completed dozens of innovative proofs of concept."
26,419," The self-service scale, for instance, integrates product recognition and has improved the shopping experience by saving customersâ time and making it easier for them to shop, all while lowering operational costs, said the company."
26,420," With conventional self-service scales, customers often needed to click through several screens to identify the correct product among hundreds of possible options. This can be confusing, often leading to customers requiring staff assistance to successfully complete the weighing process."
26,421," The OCT store has also introduced 30 smart shopping carts. A code-scanning device is installed in the front of the shopping cart, which enables customers to shop and buy without going to the cashier or self-checkout."
26,422," According to Walmart China, more innovative applications of the Omega 8 platform will be tested in the OCT store in the future. The applications will be extended to stores across the country if they prove successful."

32,481,"ByteDance said on Thursday that it had submitted its plan, which involves joining with -Oracle and Walmart, to commerce authorities under recently expanded export restrictions and was awaiting a decision."
32,482,"China's ministries in charge of commerce, and science and technology, introduced surprise changes to the country's list of restricted exports in August, adding data-processing technologies such as content-recommendation algorithms in a move widely seen as an effort to frustrate a campaign by President Donald Trump to force a sale of TikTok on national-security grounds."
32,483,"Technologies on the list can't be exported without approval from local Chinese officials. TikTok and several of ByteDance's social media apps in China are well known for their use of algorithms and artificial intelligence to tailor and push content to its users, helping them build a sizeable following."
32,484,"Gao Feng, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry, said on Thursday in a weekly briefing that Beijing's commerce bureau had received ByteDance's application for technology export. Mr Gao said the bureau would handle it according to regulations."

33,488,"Walmart is cutting some workers' hours and pay while increasing their workloads, according to workers who spoke to the Guardian, all while promising ""greater opportunity for associates to lead and take more ownership in the business""."
33,489,"The retailer has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the pandemic. In August, Walmart announced a 9.3% rise in store sales and a 97% rise in e-commerce."
33,490,"According to staff, the company is now pushing ahead with restructuring plans that for some workers has ""cut hours horrendously. It made it very difficult to pay bills."""
33,491,"Walmart began rolling out the plan - called the Great Workplace program in 2019 - but its introduction to several stores was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The program restructured staffing by consolidating departments and roles, including layoffs for those not chosen for a new role."
33,492,"Recently, Walmart released a restructuring program it said is similar to the Great Workplace program, touting the increased wages for those accepted into new management positions and pay raises in October for associates in some departments, although Walmart's minimum wage of $11 an hour remains unchanged for front-end associates. Just 165,000 employees out of Walmart's 1.5m workforce are expected to receive pay raises."
33,493,"Several former and current Walmart said the Great Workplace program included significant cuts to workers' hours, pay cuts, increased workloads, and Walmart's new teaming program is expected to bring about similar changes."
33,494,"""They combined three departments into one and then expected all the associates from those areas to fight for hours,"" said Kimberly Patrick Gray, a Walmart associate for four years in Tupelo, Mississippi, who quit on 28 February 2020 after her schedule was reduced from around 35 hours a week on average to less than 20 hours this year. ""The program just hurts the associates. It cut hours horrendously. It made it very difficult to pay bills."""
33,495,"A department manager in Arizona, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, expects to have their pay cut due to Walmart's new restructuring by at least $2.05 an hour if they aren't chosen for a team lead role, despite working over 20 years at Walmart."
33,496,"""Those that are not offered a lead position or turn down a team lead over will have till 29 January to find another position,"" they said. ""Only those department managers that get team lead positions will receive a pay raise. The rest of us will be cut in pay. If I'm lucky I will only lose $2.05 an hour. It is possible that I could lose much more."""
33,497,"Walmart said in its press release that associates in eliminated roles will maintain their current pay until October 2021, but it would not comment on what impact the changes will have on scheduled hours or workloads."
33,498,"In Oklahoma, a customer service manager for three years at Walmart, said they will now be forced to reapply for a different position if they aren't chosen for a team lead role. ""My coworkers and I feel like we are being put against each other with this whole process because we feel like we are having to fight for these positions,"" they said."
33,499,"A cashier in California explained they've recently been given extra workloads, including being given tasks of restocking and front end inventory, which used to be handled by a manager."

33,504," Eric Anderson "
33,505,"Leading up to the layoffs through Walmart's Great Workplace program, Anderson said store departments were consolidated, while workloads increased and no new hires were made to replace workers who left."
33,506,"""They all jumped through the hoops to reapply and none of them got to keep their jobs. Most were eligible for a severance for their years of service. At that point Walmart would not tell them when their last day would be, so they couldn't apply for other jobs because they didn't know when they could start,"" he said. ""When I saw how this company treated loyal long time employees, I decided I was done."""
33,507,"Walmart is the largest private employer in the US. The company touted an increase of its minimum wage to $11 an hour and up to $1,000 in bonuses for its workers, totaling around $400m, in response to the passage of Donald Trump's tax cut bill in December 2017."
33,508,"Walmart is estimated to save around $2.2bn annually from the tax cut bill. Before the bill was passed, Walmart announced plans to spend $20bn over the next two years on stock buybacks. Ken Jacobs, the chair of the University of California at Berkeley Labor Center has estimated it would cost Walmart $3.8bn to increase their minimum wage to $15 an hour, the level being lobbied for by the Fight for $15 movement, Senator Bernie Sanders and others."
33,509,"Shortly after Walmart announced the wage increases and bonuses, labor cuts began. In January 2018, Walmart announced the closure of 63 Sam's Club locations in the US, resulting in around 10,000 layoffs. In early 2019, Walmart announced it would be eliminating greeter positions at about 1,000 of its retail locations. Later that year, Walmart shut down a corporate office in Charlotte, North Carolina, laying off 570 workers as the work was outsourced to a firm in Arkansas. The company's recent Great Workplace program was expected to result in thousands of layoffs over the course of its rollout, and workers are concerned teaming will produce similar results, whether in terms of layoffs or workers leaving the company due to changes."
33,510,"Gary Stevens worked as a maintenance supervisor at a Walmart in Ticonderoga, New York, for eight years before he quit on 23 February 2020 after the Great Workplace program rollout reduced his staff by nearly 50%."
33,511,"""Work loads increased and the management was pushing us to get more done than if I had a full staff. Not one of them knew how to do my job in stripping and waxing floors, but they would tell me how long it should take and yell at me and my crew if we ran behind the time they gave us,"" Stevens said."
33,512,"A Walmart spokesperson declined to comment on complaints from workers about the program but told the Guardian: ""Walmart is retooling how associates meet the needs of customers by building a more associate-empowered way of working. There will be greater opportunity for associates to lead and take more ownership in the business."""
33,513,"The spokesperson deferred comment about the new team program to a press release on the new team-based operating model."
33,514,"""We're taking the next steps by introducing a team-based operating model in our Supercenters - similar to the one that has been very successful at Sam's Club over the past year and in our Neighborhood Market stores this year. We're investing in new roles and skills training to give us the flexibility to serve customers anytime and anywhere. In turn, associates will have more room for career and pay growth,"" said Walmart's COO, Dacona Smith."
34,515,"Away from the political drama of the TikTok deal, Walmart has been taking steps that are already changing the company and, by extension, the broader retail sector."
34,516,"Walmart's planned investment in TikTok is being called ''transformative.'' Another analyst predicted the deal could ''redefine retail'' across the industry. ''It is a bigger-picture opportunity,'' said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen. "
34,517," Known for its homogeneous big-box stores in rural and suburban America, Walmart has turned more than a few heads with its newly announced multibillion-dollar stake in a video app that is synonymous with the fun digital lives of young people."
34,518," As in the early days of many tech investments by large corporations, the details of how Walmart will use TikTok are fuzzy. But one thing is clear: Walmart now has something that its rival Amazon does not. It can engage with consumers not just when they are buying something on the retailer's website, but while they are creating and consuming viral videos."
34,519," The retailer could, for example, embed advertisements in the user-generated videos with links to the Walmart website or siphon data from the site's tens of millions of users to glean their shopping habits based on the content they posted."
34,520," The intrigue surrounding the plan by Walmart and its co-investor in TikTok, Oracle, has been heightened by the geopolitics of the deal, which President Trump threatened to block if China retains any ownership in the company."
34,521," But away from the world stage, Walmart has been making a series of moves that are already transforming the company and, by extension, the broader U.S. retail sector."
34,522," Most have involved groceries, a mundane business that seems a far cry from TikTok videos. But it has helped Walmart gain one advantage over Amazon, particularly during the pandemic. Online grocery pickup, which allows customers to order their food online and retrieve it outside the store, is at the center of this strategy."
34,523," This month, Walmart announced a new subscription delivery service, Walmart+, which some have billed as the company's answer to Amazon Prime. For $98 a year and minimum orders of $35, customers can have unlimited deliveries to their homes."
34,524," On Tuesday, UBS analysts predicted that Walmart+ would have 10 million subscribers by the end of 2021. Amazon Prime, which costs $119 a year, has about 150 million subscribers."
34,525," Walmart's service is centered on using most of its 4,700 stores as miniature e-commerce warehouses. Because the stores are close to customers' homes, that shorter delivery time should reduce costs for Walmart and keep food fresher."
34,526," Amazon has been offering similar services from its Whole Foods stores, but does not have nearly the same footprint as Walmart."
34,527," ''You see Amazon following behind Walmart on this,'' said Edward Yruma, a retail analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets."
34,528," Driven by online grocery sales, Walmart's overall e-commerce sales nearly doubled in the latest quarter. It may be difficult to keep growing at that rate, though, as other large grocers like Albertsons and Kroger start to ramp up their online ordering and curbside grocery pickup."
34,529," Success in online grocery has led to more hiring, which is significant for Walmart, the nation's largest private employer. The company's head count had been relatively steady for several years. But the pandemic has required more help, as shoppers have come to stock up amid the lockdowns."
34,530," Walmart has increased its work force by 14 percent since last year, according to Drew Holler, head of human resources at Walmart's U.S. stores."
34,531," Last week, the company announced that it was overhauling management roles in its supercenters, a move that has big implications for how many of its 1.5 million employees are paid and promoted."
34,532," Some jobs overseeing traditional in-store departments are being phased out, while other store employees in departments like bakery and automotive care are receiving raises."
34,533," ''We are repositioning our stores for what we think the future of retail is going to look like,'' Mr. Holler said in an interview."
34,534," To that end, some analysts say, Walmart should be investing in the stores and e-commerce infrastructure rather than spending billions on investments like TikTok."
34,535," Scott Mushkin, founder of the consumer research firm R5 Capital and a longtime Wall Street analyst, said Walmart should be focusing more on automating its online grocery process to reduce costs or even bolstering its fresh food offerings."
34,536," Even with the subscription fees for Walmart+, Mr. Mushkin and other analysts calculate that the retailer will lose money on each home delivery."
34,537," ''Maybe TikTok is a magic wand,'' Mr. Mushkin said. ''But why blow money on a deal like that when they could be investing in automation in the grocery-picking process?''"
34,538," Other analysts say the Walmart+ offering, after much fanfare and anticipation, will never be able to compete with Prime, which has no minimum order and includes streaming entertainment."
34,539," The major Walmart+ perk is a 5-cent-a-gallon discount at affiliated gas stations."
34,540," ''It is not as powerful as what we imagined,'' analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note this week. In June, before the details of the services were announced, the investment bank had predicted that as many as 20 million people could sign up within a few months and that Walmart's stock would soar in value."
34,541," In a statement this weekend, Walmart said TikTok would be ''an important way for us to expand our reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace, fulfillment and advertising businesses.''"
34,542," The proposed investment in TikTok sounds rather vague, but many analysts said they were willing to give Walmart time to work out the details."
34,543," ''The future of retail is community engagement where users are creating content,'' said Mr. Chen, the Cowen analyst. ''Walmart is taking a very proactive stance.''"

So far in 2020, the company has inaugurated three new distribution centers in the country, which have represented an investment of more than 2 thousand 640 million pesos, which are located in the State of Mexico, Chihuahua and Merida. Walmart in Mexico and Central America currently has a total of 19 distribution centers in Mexico. The Distribution Center of Merida, Yucatan, has approximately 200 thousand square meters and distributes merchandise directly to more than 90 stores of different business formats of the company: Bodega Aurrera, Walmart, Superama and Sam's Club, as well as for e-commerce orders in the states of Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo. With the complex, 725 direct jobs and more than 450 indirect jobs were created. In a statement sent to the Stock Exchange, Walmart of Mexico and Central America maintained that it maintains its planned investment plans in the country. ""This Cedi, in conjunction with the others opened this year, are part of the company's goal of bringing products closer to the 2,000 stores it has in the country,"" he said. Monex financial group analysts considered the news to be positive for the broadcaster, as business management could generate favorable synergies for Walmart formats. "

37,556,"NEW YORK/PALO ALTO, U.S.-- President Donald Trump has given the go-ahead to a deal for Oracle and Walmart to maintain TikTok's operations in the U.S., with the two American companies set to own 20% of a new entity created in agreement with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance. "
37,557,"""I have given the deal my blessing, if they get it done that's great, if they don't that's fine too,"" Trump told reporters on Saturday, hours before a ban on U.S. downloads of the popular video-sharing app was due to take effect. "
37,558,"Oracle, the Silicon Valley enterprise software giant, will become TikTok's technology partner and responsible for ""hosting all U.S. user data and securing associated computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are fully satisfied"", TikTok said in a statement on Saturday shortly after President Trump spoke. "
37,559,"The widely popular short video app said it is also working on a commercial partnership with Walmart. Under the three-way partnership, an entity called TikTok Global will be created and will ""maintain and expand"" TikTok's current headquarters in the U.S., the company said in a statement. "
37,560,"In a joint statement by Oracle and Walmart, the companies said TikTok Global will have an initial public offering within 12 months and be listed on a U.S. exchange. Four Americans will be on a five-member TikTok Global board, they said. "
37,561,"Oracle and Walmart will take part in a TikTok Global financing round ahead of an IPO in which they can take up to a 20% cumulative stake in the company, both companies confirmed. "
37,562,"Oracle said it will take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global. "
37,563,"""As a part of this agreement, TikTok will run on the Oracle Cloud and Oracle will become a minority investor in TikTok Global,"" said Oracle CEO Safra Catz in a statement. "
37,564,"Walmart said in its own statement that it had ""tentatively agreed to purchase 7.5% of TikTok Global"" and provide ecommerce and other services. CEO Doug McMillon would be a board member of the newly created company, Walmart said. "
37,565,"President Trump and his administration had targeted TikTok, along with the Chinese-owned WeChat app, over national security concerns. "
37,566,"On Saturday Trump said the new entity will ""be a brand new company... It will have nothing to do with China. It will be totally secure."" "
37,567,"Trump said that as part of the deal TikTok Global would contribute $5 billion to U.S. education. ""We're going to be setting up a very large fund toward the education of American youth. And that'll be great. That's their contribution that I've been asking for,"" the President told reporters on Saturday. "
37,568,"Oracle and Walmart confirmed in the joint statement that ""TikTok Global, together with Oracle, SIG, General Atlantic, Sequoia, Walmart and Coatue will create a multi-billion dollar education foundation to develop and deliver an AI-driven online video curriculum to teach children from inner cities to the suburbs a variety of courses from basic reading and math to science, history and computer engineering."" "
37,569,"However, TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance said in a statement that they had only heard about the education fund today. "
37,570,"""We will reach an agreement that satisfies both the U.S. and China's regulatory requirements soon,"" ByteDance said. "
37,571,"While other financial details of the deal remain unclear, the social media app said TikTok Global would create at least 25,000 jobs in the U.S. The joint statement by Walmart and Oracle said TikTok Global would pay more than $5 billion in new taxes to the U.S. Treasury. "
37,572,"The Chinese government has not signed off on the deal. Beijing previously announced the addition of several artificial intelligence technologies, including ""personalized content recommendations based on data analysis,"" to its list of restricted exports, which created a major roadblock for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations. "
37,573,"TikTok is facing a U.S. ban if a deal is not reached. The widely popular short video app was due to be removed from U.S. app stores from Sunday. That has now been postponed for a week until Sep. 27 as a deal draws closer. "
37,574,"The China-owned app will face a ""real shutdown"" after Nov. 12 in the absence of a deal, according to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. "
37,575,"In a statement released on Saturday, China's Ministry of Commerce said it ""firmly opposes"" the U.S. decision to ban WeChat and TikTok. It added that it will ""take necessary measures"" to safeguard the interests of Chinese companies if the U.S. does not stop its ""wrongdoing."""
38,576,"Walmart is getting ready for a different holiday season amid the coronavirus pandemic."
38,577,"The retailer announced plans Wednesday to meet the demands of increased online shopping, gift availability and how it is preparing stores for ""safe shopping."""
38,578,"Walmart is ""promising an all-new Black Friday experience"" and says it ""will spread traditional Black Friday savings throughout the season,"" with more deals available online."
38,579,"While Walmart says the savings will start earlier than ever, the full details on its Black Friday experience weren't unveiled Wednesday."
38,580,"However, the retailer said it was hiring 20,000 seasonal workers for its eCommerce fulfillment centers, including order fillers and power equipment operators."
38,581,"The temporary positions are posted at www.walmartcareers.com/fcjobs and can also be applied for by texting FC to 240240."
38,582,"Greg Smith, Walmart's U.S. executive vice president of supply chain, said in a news release that as more shoppers ""turn to online shopping, we want to ensure we're staffed and ready to help deliver that special gift to their loved ones while continuing to fulfill our customer's everyday needs."""
38,583,"The starting hourly rate for the seasonal jobs will range from $15.75 to $23.75 based on location, position and schedule."
38,584,"Over the past six months, Walmart says it has hired more than 500,000 new employees across the company ""to ensure the retailer could provide essential items to customers during the COVID-19 pandemic."""
38,585,"Different holiday season, different gifts"
38,586,"Walmart hinted at the different holiday season in July, when it announced stores would be closed on Thanksgiving for the first time since the late 1980s."
38,587,"Home Depot, Target and Best Buy have said they will start offering deals for the holiday season earlier to reduce crowds and to spread out demand amid COVID-19."
38,588,"Scott McCall, Walmart's U.S. executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, said in the release that customers have been shopping differently over the past six months."
38,589,"That is expected to continue into the holiday season."
38,590,"""We've heard from our customers that many plan on starting their holiday shopping well before Black Friday, and that they're looking for gifts that fit their current lifestyle,"" McCall said. ""So, we've adjusted our strategy to adapt to these new shopping preferences - we're offering more of what they want now, earlier than ever, and all at the best prices."""
38,591,"The retailer is ""increasing availability of unexpected holiday gifts that reflect lifestyles in this 'new normal,' including athleisure, loungewear and sleepwear for the family, outdoor grills, bicycles and exercise equipment and outdoor sporting equipment."""
38,592,"Walmart says it has also increased inventory of traditional gifts, including electronics with a ""focus on TVs, laptops and video games"" and will have over 1,300 new toys ."
38,593,"There also will be a larger assortment of supply of pet products and Walmart says it's ""ready to sell over 3 million comfy pet beds."" "
39,594,"If there's one thing TikTok users love, it's Walmart. The American retail giant has ridden in to become the app's unlikely saviour, and together with software giant Oracle, it is attempting to avert an impending ban of the app in the US."
39,595,"A deal with TikTok's Chinese owner Bytedance is currently being discussed, and would see the US firms take a stake in a new TikTok Global business. This would, in theory, ring fence the app's international operations and data and allay fears over Beijing's influence."
39,596,"But that isn't the reason Walmart has such a following on the viral video app, which has more than two billion downloads globally. In fact, searching Walmart-related hashtags turns up almost no commentary on the deal."
39,597,"Instead, you'll find a thriving community of Walmart bargain hunters and clearance sale detectives, racking up millions of views from young Americans seeking the cheapest possible way to stock up their lives and look sharp."
39,598,"If their videos were paid for by Walmart, they carry no sign of it, and the chain's official TikTok page is comparatively unpopular with just 1.9m total likes."
39,599,"All of which suggests that there is serious demand for commercial activity on TikTok - and that Walmart's involvement in a tie-up with its Chinese owners is not so strange as it seems."
39,600,"""For Generation Z, what is a store?"" asks Alex Zukin, an analyst at RBC Capital. ""Is that just a warehouse where all the stuff I want is stored? Why do I have to go there? The digital world is the nexus of their relationships, whether it be on YouTube, TikTok, WeChat or WhatsApp... it's not at a mall, it's not in the physical world. So why would commerce be anchored to the physical realm?"" What Zukin is describing is a long-prophesied form of e-commerce that has never quite got off the ground in the West, but whose blowout success in China in recent years has many marketers salivating: ""social commerce""."
39,601,"Currently, social media users endure a hailstorm of adverts trying to coax them away to separate shopping websites. Many of those adverts are ""retargeting"" campaigns, aimed at bringing back users who started to buy a certain product but gave up or forgot halfway through."
39,602,"Letting users buy products directly within their favoured apps closes that gap between intention and action, grabbing consumers right at the moment when their interest has been piqued (and perhaps before they have had time to really think the purchase through). Generation Z-friendly apps such as Instagram and Snapchat are clearly intrigued - and have already started to make forays into the space."
39,603,"Instagram first launched features to allow users to ""shop"" posts back in 2017, with companies and influencers able to tag items in their pictures with prices and names so users could then search for them."
39,604,"Last year, the Facebook-owned app went one step further and introduced an in-app checkout feature for brands such as Nike, Dior and H&M, to let people buy items directly over Instagram. Similar tentative steps have been taken at Snapchat, where followers of certain influencers and brands are able to swipe up on posts to buy items. Zukin says a tie-up between Walmart and TikTok could propel the grocery giant forward in its own ambitions: ""The ability to have the least amount of friction between seeing something you want and buying it - if it can be directly integrated into TikTok, similarly to how it's integrated into Instagram - that's powerful. It's something that I don't believe Amazon currently has."""
39,605,"Indeed, social media - and, perhaps, Generation Z itself - is a rare hole in Amazon's empire. Its most viable platform for social commerce would be Twitch, the video-game-centric live streaming channel that it bought in 2014 for $970m (Â£760m). But even among ""Zoomers"", not everyone is a gamer, so its reach may be limited."
39,606,"That is where Walmart comes in."
39,607,"The company is a land-hogging behemoth, with more than 11,000 locations in 27 countries (including Britain's Asda, which it is in the process of selling), more revenue than any oil company and a workforce that rivals the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Today, however, it is also locked in a race with rival Amazon online, and so far it's losing. For one thing, Amazon's online inventory is significantly larger, at an estimated 129 million products, whereas www.Walmart.com is reported to sell around 80 million items. The tech titan also has a wealth of ""third-party sellers"" who use the site to find buyers, and provide Amazon with a steady stream of income."
39,608,"All this has meant that Amazon's market share in e-commerce dwarfs its rivals. Last year, Amazon accounted for around 40pc of total e-commerce sales. Walmart had the second largest market share in the US ecommerce market, although only held a 5.3pc share, according to figures from eMarketer."
39,609,"The grocery giant will be hoping that social commerce on TikTok offers it a rare opportunity to lead, not follow. In announcing its interest in TikTok, Walmart said the app's integration of e-commerce and advertising ""is a clear benefit to creators and users in those markets""."
39,610,"A deal would ""provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses""."
39,611,"Walmart is likely to look to China for how such a partnership could work. There, Douyin, TikTok's sister viral video app, has been testing ecommerce features since 2018, and Chinese favourites such as Xiaomi and www.Suning.com use the app to sell to customers."
39,612,"The pay-off can be significant."
39,613,"Last month, during a two-hour live-stream of Xiaomi boss Lei Jun on Douyin, the company generated 210m RMB (Â£24.3m) of sales, attracting more than 50 million views - a record for the app."
39,614,"""It is quite normal in China to have a live-stream where they sell millions of products in just a few minutes,"" says Alessandro Bogliari, chief executive of the Influencer Marketing Factory. ""People in the US and Europe are not so used to it. But this is the future, and where everyone is going. So I think it's time to integrate social commerce."""
39,615,"Still, even if Walmart does not use TikTok to propel its e-commerce efforts, the app may not actually need to do anything special to count as a win. Instead, it only needs to make the kind of healthy profit typical of big tech firms, supplementing the cellophane-thin margins of traditional retail (prior to Covid, Walmart's margin was about 3pc)."
39,616,"Compare TikTok, says Zukin, to the role of Amazon's cloud services division, AWS, whose soaring profits since 2015 have transformed its overall finances. ""That's the business where Amazon gets all their margin and weaponry to compete more aggressively with Walmart,"" he says. Having a similar sideline would give Walmart more firepower to fight back."
39,617,"Zukin derisively observes that this would still only make it ""a poor man's Amazon"". Then again, given that Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is currently as wealthy as about 506,000 median British households, perhaps being the poor man's Amazon - perhaps literally - is not such a modest ambition."

41,630,"Away from the political drama of the TikTok deal, Walmart has been taking steps that are already changing the company and, by extension, the broader retail sector."
41,631,"Walmartâs planned investment in TikTok is being called âtransformative.â Another analyst predicted the deal could âredefine retailâ across the industry. âIt is a bigger-picture opportunity,â said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen."
41,632,"Known for its homogeneous big-box stores in rural and suburban America, Walmart has turned more than a few heads with its newly announced multibillion-dollar stake in a video app that is synonymous with the fun digital lives of young people."
41,633,"As in the early days of many tech investments by large corporations, the details of how Walmart will use TikTok are fuzzy. But one thing is clear: Walmart now has something that its rival Amazon does not. It can engage with consumers not just when they are buying something on the retailerâs website, but while they are creating and consuming viral videos."
41,634,"The retailer could, for example, embed advertisements in the user-generated videos with links to the Walmart website or siphon data from the siteâs tens of millions of users to glean their shopping habits based on the content they posted."
41,635,"The intrigue surrounding the plan by Walmart and its co-investor in TikTok, Oracle, has been heightened by the geopolitics of the deal, which President Trump threatened to block if China retains any ownership in the company."
41,636,"But away from the world stage, Walmart has been making a series of moves that are already transforming the company and, by extension, the broader U.S. retail sector."
41,637,"Most have involved groceries, a mundane business that seems a far cry from TikTok videos. But it has helped Walmart gain one advantage over Amazon, particularly during the pandemic. Online grocery pickup, which allows customers to order their food online and retrieve it outside the store, is at the center of this strategy."
41,638,"This month, Walmart announced a new subscription delivery service, Walmart+, which some have billed as the companyâs answer to Amazon Prime. For $98 a year and minimum orders of $35, customers can have unlimited deliveries to their homes."
41,639,"On Tuesday, UBS analysts predicted that Walmart+ would have 10 million subscribers by the end of 2021. Amazon Prime, which costs $119 a year, has about 150 million subscribers."
41,640,"Walmartâs service is centered on using most of its 4,700 stores as miniature e-commerce warehouses. Because the stores are close to customersâ homes, that shorter delivery time should reduce costs for Walmart and keep food fresher."
41,641,"Amazon has been offering similar services from its Whole Foods stores, but does not have nearly the same footprint as Walmart."
41,642,"âYou see Amazon following behind Walmart on this,â said Edward Yruma, a retail analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets."
41,643,"Driven by online grocery sales, Walmartâs overall e-commerce sales nearly doubled in the latest quarter. It may be difficult to keep growing at that rate, though, as other large grocers like Albertsons and Kroger start to ramp up their online ordering and curbside grocery pickup."
41,644,"Success in online grocery has led to more hiring, which is significant for Walmart, the nationâs largest private employer. The companyâs head count had been relatively steady for several years. But the pandemic has required more help, as shoppers have come to stock up amid the lockdowns."
41,645,"Walmart has increased its work force by 14 percent since last year, according to Drew Holler, head of human resources at Walmartâs U.S. stores."
41,646,"Last week, the company announced that it was overhauling management roles in its supercenters, a move that has big implications for how many of its 1.5 million employees are paid and promoted."
41,647,"Some jobs overseeing traditional in-store departments are being phased out, while other store employees in departments like bakery and automotive care are receiving raises."
41,648,"âWe are repositioning our stores for what we think the future of retail is going to look like,â Mr. Holler said in an interview."
41,649,"To that end, some analysts say, Walmart should be investing in the stores and e-commerce infrastructure rather than spending billions on investments like TikTok."
41,650,"Scott Mushkin, founder of the consumer research firm R5 Capital and a longtime Wall Street analyst, said Walmart should be focusing more on automating its online grocery process to reduce costs or even bolstering its fresh food offerings."
41,651,"Even with the subscription fees for Walmart+, Mr. Mushkin and other analysts calculate that the retailer will lose money on each home delivery."
41,652,"âMaybe TikTok is a magic wand,â Mr. Mushkin said. âBut why blow money on a deal like that when they could be investing in automation in the grocery-picking process?â"
41,653,"Other analysts say the Walmart+ offering, after much fanfare and anticipation, will never be able to compete with Prime, which has no minimum order and includes streaming entertainment."
41,654,"The major Walmart+ perk is a 5-cent-a-gallon discount at affiliated gas stations."
41,655,"âIt is not as powerful as what we imagined,â analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note this week. In June, before the details of the services were announced, the investment bank had predicted that as many as 20 million people could sign up within a few months and that Walmartâs stock would soar in value."
41,656,"In a statement this weekend, Walmart said TikTok would be âan important way for us to expand our reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace, fulfillment and advertising businesses.â"
41,657,"The proposed investment in TikTok sounds rather vague, but many analysts said they were willing to give Walmart time to work out the details."
41,658,"âThe future of retail is community engagement where users are creating content,â said Mr. Chen, the Cowen analyst. âWalmart is taking a very proactive stance.â"

42,660,"Great rivalries can bring out the best of both parties and this appears to be the case for Walmart and Amazon as they battle for their share of shoppers' wallets (James Dean writes). It is no surprise that both companies have fared well during the pandemic, but it is notable that Walmart's online grocery business seems to have more than just kept pace with Amazon's."
42,661,"Walmart books more than half a trillion dollars a year in sales, making it the world's largest retailer by that mark. The $390 billion company is founded on bricks and mortar, unlike Amazon, the $1.6 trillion ecommerce group. As Walmart grows its presence online, Amazon enlarges its enviable distribution network in the real world."
42,662,"The battle between the two companies centres on the United States. Indeed, Walmart's attempts to offload Asda are little more than a distraction as the American group pours resources into its domestic business and technology investments. Its purchase of a majority stake in India's Flipkart two years ago, and its more recent attempt to buy a slice of China's TikTok, show its ambitions in the sector. However, boring old groceries rather than flashy technology are the crux of the Walmart-Amazon rivalry."
42,663,"The US grocery market will be worth $682 billion this year, according to Ibis World, a research firm. Online sales will account for only 4 per cent of the market, research by UBS suggests. However, online sales grew by about 15 per cent in the year to July compared with the same period a year before, a report by Tabs Analytics found. For online shopping of all kinds, Amazon continues to dominate. It will take 38.7 per cent of ecommerce sales in the US this year, research by Emarketer suggests. Walmart trails in second place, with 5.3 per cent, and Ebay is third with 4.7 per cent."
42,664,"However, Walmart dominates US groceries. It has a 21.3 per cent share of the market, more than double second-placed Kroger's 9.9 per cent and significantly more than Amazon's 2.2 per cent, research from UBS shows. And when it comes to online grocery deliveries, Walmart has always had one advantage that Amazon lacks: the basis of a national delivery network. Walmart says that nine in ten Americans live within ten minutes of one of its supermarkets, which double as delivery hubs. Amazon is trying to catch up by building thousands more localised hubs for its distribution network but this is taking time and money."
42,665,"Walmart is also doffing its cap to its rival. Two weeks ago it launched Walmart+, a $98-a-year membership scheme offering free grocery deliveries. It is, of course, taking on Prime, Amazon's hugely successful free delivery membership scheme, which costs $119 a year and has 150 million subscribers."
42,666,"Compared with Amazon Prime, Walmart+ is limited. It does not yet offer free delivery of non-grocery products from www.Walmart.com, many of which are sold by third party merchants. Further, Walmart+ does not come with free video and music streaming services and other benefits unrelated to free delivery."
42,667,"Nonetheless, analysts are generally positive about its prospects."
42,668,"Given its dominance of ecommerce, one might have expected Amazon to be ahead in the online grocery game, but that does not appear to be the case. The Tabs Analytics report suggests that Walmart overtook Amazon in online grocery transactions for the first time in the year to July, taking 30 per cent to Amazon's 27 per cent. This is an impressive performance, showing that Walmart is capable of holding its own - and perhaps more - against the world's largest ecommerce group in the lucrative US market for groceries."
